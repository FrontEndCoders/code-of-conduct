# Code of Conduct

## About the Front-End Coders

The Front-End Coders is a worldwide community of people passionate about Front-End and Web Development.

Our focus is to build a community of people willing to help others in growing their knowledge and advise who has the desire to build their local community or Front-End event.

If you are reading this, that means you are interested in being part of that community, and we're glad you're here!

## Why have a Code of Conduct?

The Front-End Coders Global community includes people from around the world. Our contributors are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, disability, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristic.

The first goal of the Code of Conduct is to specify a baseline standard of behavior so that people with different social values and communication styles can communicate effectively, productively, and respectfully.

The second goal is to provide a mechanism for resolving conflicts in the community when they arise.

The third goal of the Code of Conduct is to make our community welcoming to people from different backgrounds. Diversity is critical in order for us to build a thriving community.

With that said, a healthy community must allow for disagreement and debate. The Code of Conduct is not a mechanism for people to silence others with whom they disagree.

## Where does the Code of Conduct apply?

At the moment, the Code of Conduct only apply on the Front-End Coders Global group on Facebook.

## Our values
These are the values to which people in the Front-End Coders community should aspire.

* Be friendly and welcoming

* Be patient
  * Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language (meaning and tone can be lost in translation).

* Be thoughtful
  * Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.
  Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.

* Be respectful
  * In particular, respect differences of opinion.

* Be charitable
  * Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree. When we do disagree, try to understand why.

* Avoid destructive behavior:
  * **Derailing**: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.
  * **Unconstructive criticism**: don't merely condemn the current state of affairs; offer—or at least solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.
  * **Snarking** (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)
  * **Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues**; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.
  * **Microaggressions**: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral, and environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a person or group.
  * People are complicated. You should expect to be misunderstood and to misunderstand others; when this inevitably occurs, resist the urge to be defensive or assign blame. Try not to take offense where no offense was intended. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Even if the intent was to provoke, do not rise to it. It is the responsibility of all parties to de-escalate conflict when it arises.
